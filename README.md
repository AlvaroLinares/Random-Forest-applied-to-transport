# Random-Forest-applied-to-transport

# Abstract

The transport area is quite wide about the possibilities of interventions in the transport infrastructure of any modal. Within this scope is traffic engineering, which primarily studies the circulation of transport vehicles on the roads. In parallel, there is a growth in the use of data science for the construction of Machine Learning models in order to perform predictions and classifications. Thus, uniting these two fields of knowledge, the group's objective was to apply the Random Forest method to obtain short-term traffic forecasts using data from vehicle identification systems located on Avenida 23 de Maio. Provided by the Secretaria Municipal de Transportes (SMT), this data contained information about the 30 days of March 2018 and the task consisted of creating a machine learning model with the Python language to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm to obtain the prediction of the values of traffic flows in interval of an hour, from a certain cutoff time. Thus, the first stage of this process consisted of a literature review on the method and the most immersive learning in the construction of the model. After that, the code was built considering the arrangement of data in time series and tests were carried out in intervals of 30 minutes for each day week. Satisfactory results were obtained when compared to the mean of traffic flows from previous weeks, that is, in about 72,4% of the tests, the model beat the mean.
